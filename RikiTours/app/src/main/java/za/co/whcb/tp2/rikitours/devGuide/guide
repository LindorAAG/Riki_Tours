#DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

    *Naming
        1 @package should be name in lowercase
        2 @variable are named in camelcase ( meaning starting with lower case)
            e.g
                int number
                int numberOfEmployees
           @variable name should not be more than 25 letters

        3 @Functions are name should be named in camelcase as well
            @function should not have more 3 parameters
                * Ideally use an array  in case of more parameters needed
                * Function definition should not have more thn 20 lines
                    in case of more line needed create private function and call it in the
                    function

                    e.g
                        public personDetails(String name,String surname,int yearBorn) {
                            String details = "Name="+name+"\nSurname="+surname;

                            return details+"\nAge :"+ ageCalculator(yearBorn);

                        }

                        private int ageCalculator (int year) {
                            return getYearfromCalendar - year;
                        }
